# Who are we

It's a digital infrastructure for reporting issues we're going through as a community. We're building the biggest database of issues anywhere around the world with a focus on third-world countries. We all have many needs that the government or we as a society can come together and solve. CommunityWatch aims to provide a platform where we can report these issues, find the issues & act in whatever way we can to foster positive change.


## Why did we build CommunityWatch

The government cannot have its eyes everywhere. We, the people need to come together and aid the government and NGOs in discovering what issues we have in our communities. The government cannot spend it's time solving a non-existent issue or an issue which it's not aware of. The same way you need to identify a problem in order to come up with a fix for it. 

Governments need to take advantage of technology to come up with creative ways of solving problems. For this, we need to first have a database of issues. The government can now take advantage of techniques like data mining, machine learning, geolocation and many more to prioritize which issues need fixing. 

Creating this database is what CommunityWatch aims to solve. We aim to use techniques like machine learning to categorize issues and direct the issues to the responsible channels. Issues about sanitization need to be directed to government institutions responsible for sanitization or NGOs who're interested in solving sanitization problems. Electricity issues also need to be sent to people like KPLC for instance. Road issues also channeled to the relevant authorities. 

### Our Vision

We aim to be a platform like [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org). We have work in place to make the data on reported issues Free, Open & Accessible by anyone wherever they are. 
At the moment, CommunityWatch can be used in:
  1. Kenya
  2. Rwanda
  3. Uganda
  4. Tanzania

Adding support for new countries isn't trivial. Please reach out if you want to CommunityWatch supported in your country.

We sincerely want to thank https://gadm.org for providing us with region level data and for making the process of accessing this data easy.
